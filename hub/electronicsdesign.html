        <h1>Electronics Design</h1>

        <p>For electronics design we will be using the electronic design automation (EDA) software EAGLE.</p>



        <h2>Adding Libraries</h2>

        <p>Before we can use the component symbols in a schematic, we first have to add their libraries.</p>

        <p>This is very much like Arduino Library addition and updating, simply download the library file followed by
            pasting it into the EAGLE library folder.</p>

        <p>First we head to https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/pub/libraries/electronics to download the file.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library1.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We then click on the eagle folder to open it.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library2.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We then click on 'fab.lr'.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library3.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We then click on the 'download' button in the top right to download it.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library4.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We then use file explorer to find our Eagle Library folder. By default, it should be in the documents folder.
            We then open the 'EAGLE' folder.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library5.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>Click on 'libraries'.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library6.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>Then paste our 'eagle_fab.lbr' file here.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library7.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>After pasting it, head over to the control panel and right click on the library, followed by clicking 'use'.
            Alternatively, we can also click on the grey circle.</p>

        <p>A green light should now appear to indicate the library is 'in use'.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/eaglelibrary.png" width=60%>

        <p>Now that everything is configured, we are able to start creating our schematics.</p>

        <h2>Assignment</h2>

        <p>For our assignment, we were supposed to refer to a schematic and reimplement it in Eagle, along with a
            pull-up resistor and LED. Below is the image of the original schematic.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/04_t45_hello-board.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We first start by heading to the Eagle control panel and creating a new project.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic1.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We then create a new schematic by right clicking on the project folder and clicking on 'new' into
            'schematic'.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic2.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We then enter the schematic screen.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic3.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>To start off, I hit Ctrl + S to save the schematic before I start, I will continue to use Ctrl + S throughout
            to save my work.</p>

        <p>Following that, I click on the grid icon to enable the grid. This will help when laying out the components.
            Either lines or dots can be used to form the grid but I prefer dots.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic4.png" class="border" width=40%>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic5.png" class="border" width=40%>

        <p>Now that we are done with setting up, we can start creating our schematic.</p>

        <p>In order to add components to the schematic, we use 'add parts'. The shortcut for this is Ctrl Shift A.
            Alternatively, it can be accessed through 2 ways:</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic6.png" class="border" width=40%>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic7.png" class="border" width=40%>

        <h3>Adding components</h3>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic8.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>This is the adding menu, here I have moved down to the Eagle Library by pressing E. Here, we can browse the
            library for the various components that we want.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, we can search for the various components that we want to save some time. I'll show this by
            adding a frame to our schematic.</p>

        <p>We do so by searching for 'frame'. This searches for frames which we can use to encompass our schematic.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic9.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>After selecting an appropriate frame, simply drag it onto the grid.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic10.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>Next up, I'll search for my ATtiny45 IC to show how to use wildcards in the search bar.</p>

        <p>By entering '*tiny45*' in the search bar, we make use of wildcards, this means that do we not need to enter
            the exact name of the component, hence why our ATtiny45 IC shows up.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic11.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>Again, drag and drop onto the desired position on the grid.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic12.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>Now we have our IC.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic13.png" width=60%>

        <p>I then proceeded to search for the rest of the components such as the ISP header</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic14.png" width=60%>

        <p>Now that I have all my components I can start arranging them like in the schematic and wiring them up.</p>

        <p>I have also added the LED, push button and additional resistor as the assignment requires.</p>


        <h3>Wiring up the components</h3>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic15.png" width=60%>

        <p>The shortcut for the wiring net is Alt N. I first begin by wiring up the easy components such as ground and
            VCC for ICs, refering to the original schematic as much as possible.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic16.png" width=60%>

        <p>Now that I have wired everything according to the schematic and implemented the pull-up resistor for an input
            and an LED for its output, I can now finally add values to components such as resistors.</p>

        <h3>Adding components' values</h3>

        <p>In order to add the values of our components to the schematic, we need to use the 'values' tool. It can be
            found on the toolbar on the left as seen below:</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic17.png" width=60%>

        <p>After selecting the value tool, simply click any components which require their values such as this pull-up
            resistor. I'll input 10k as 10k ohms should be sufficient for a pull-up resistor.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic18.png" width=60%>

        <p>After labelling both resistors and the single capacitor we are done with our schematic.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic19.png" width=60%>

        <h3>Wrong pull-up resistor location</h3>

        <p>After checking my final schematic, I realised that my pull-up resistor was incorrectly placed. It should be
            placed below the VCC instead of directly to the pin 2 of the ATtiny45. Below is the rectified schematic.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic20.png" width=60%>

        <p>Now, current will flow into PB3 when the switch is not pressed, hence the input of PB3 being 'pulled up' to
            the high VCC voltage. When the button is pressed, current will instead flow through the resistor and instead
            of to PB3, go to the ground, hence PB3 receiving an input of low.</p>

        <h2>Electric Rule Checking (ERC)</h2>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/ERC.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>Before we convert our schematic to a PCB layout, we have to use the ERC tool to check whether our schematic
            is </p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/ERCchecking.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>As can be seen, there are no critical errors, only non-critical warnings about issues such as me not
            assigning values to my ATTiny45 board and S1, my switch which are alright with me.</p>

        <p>Now that we have ensured there are no errors with our schematic, we can move onto our next step.</p>

        <h2>Converting schematic to PCB layout</h2>

        <p>We can convert our schematic to a PCB layout by:</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/convert.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We are then greeted by this:</p>






        <h2>PCB layout</h2>

        <p>Now that we have our components on our PCB layout, we can now </p>

        <h3>Laying out the solder </h3>



        <h2>Design Rule Checking</h2>

        <p>We can use the DRC tool to verify whether our PCB layout meets the </p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/DRC1.png" width=60%>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/DRC2.png" width=60%>


        <h2>Converting our PCB layout in Eagle to a .nc or gcode file</h2>

        <p>There are 2 ways of converting our PCB layout in Eagle to a .nc or gcode file.</p>

        <p>First, there is the Eagle User Language Programme(ULP) which will immediately export a gcode file.</p>

        <p>Second will be exporting a PNG through Eagle followed by using Mods to convert the PNG to a .nc file.</p>

        <p>I will be using the second method, since I can't exactly get the pcb-gcode ULP window to open.</p>

        <h2>Configuring the pcb-gcode ULP</h3>



            <h3>Using Mods</h3>

            <p>We use the built in export function in Eagle:</p>


















            <p>Remember to set the only layer in which you want to export as visible. For instance, when exporting the
                traces, set only the top layer as visible and for the outline, only the milling layer as visible.</p>



            <img src="IMAGES/ED/failexample.png" width=60%>

            <p>If we were to configure it in mods immediately, viewing its output in ncviewer, we get this:</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/ED/failedexamplencviewer.png" class="border" width=60%>

            <p>As can be seen, the drill bit is cutting multiple times on </p>

            <p>We now have to fix our outline PNG.</p>

            <p>In order to fix this, we can use either MS paint or GIMP. I used paint since its much lighter than GIMP
                and the task really doesn't require the many tools that GIMP has.</p>

            <p>I simply use the eyedropper tool to select the color that is being used by the rectangle, in this case
                white.</p>

            <p>Now we have the same shade of white selected, we can use the paint bucket to fill the exterior.</p>

            <p>Verifying it in ncviewer, we now have the appropriate cutting path of the outline of our PCB.</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/ED/ncvieweroutline.png" class="border" width=60%>


            <p>Finally, we have our 2 PNGs of our traces and outline.</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/ED/tracescharlie.png" class="border" width=40%>

            <img src="IMAGES/ED/outlinecharlie.png" class="border" width=40%>

            <p>Now we head to mods, where we configure the settings appropriately.</p>

            <br>

            <h2>Verifying our .nc file</h2>

            <p>With ncviewer, I can view the path of the CNC when milling the board.</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/ED/ncvieweroutline.png" class="border" width=40%>

            <img src="IMAGES/ED/ncviewertraces.png" class="border" width=40%>

            <p>After checking with ncviewer, we can now mill our PCB.</p>

            <h2>Milling my first PCB</h2>

            <p>Milling the PCB is easy, </p>




            <h2>Rectifying my PCB outline</h2>

            <p>In order to fix the issue</p>

            <h2>End copper board</h2>

            <p>Here is my copper board after milling the traces. The cutting is pretty good, there are no burrs.</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/ED/final1.jpg" width=60%>

            <p>Here is my copper board after milling the outline.</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/ED/final2.jpg" width=60%>

            <p>After removal, I'm quite satisfied with it, there are no burrs on the copper tracks which results in me
                not having to do any sanding to remove the burrs which could damage the copper tracks.</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/ED/final3.jpg" width=60%>

            <p>Here is my completed bare board after removing the dead copper:</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/ED/final4.jpg" width=60%>

            <p>I'm happy with how it turned out and the settings I used, I just need to solder on the SMT components
                now.</p>


            <h2>Soldering the components</h2>

            <p>I first started by soldering on my IC followed by checking the pins with a DMM. I then soldered on my
                switch and capacitor</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/ED/HELLO1.jpg" width=60%>

            <p>I then soldered on the rest of my components. The soldering quality on this board is slightly better than
                the ISP board but still not great.</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/ED/HELLO2.jpg" width=60%>
