        <h1>Electronics Design</h1>

        <p>For electronics design we will be using the electronic design automation (EDA) software EAGLE.</p>

        

        <h2>Adding Libraries</h2>

        <p>Before we can use the component symbols in a schematic, we first have to add their libraries.</p>

        <p>This is very much like Arduino Library addition and updating, simply download the library file followed by pasting it into the EAGLE library folder.</p>

        <p>First we head to https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/pub/libraries/electronics to download the file.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library1.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We then click on the eagle folder to open it.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library2.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We then click on 'fab.lr'.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library3.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We then click on the 'download' button in the top right to download it.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library4.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We then use file explorer to find our Eagle Library folder. By default, it should be in the documents folder. We then open the 'EAGLE' folder.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library5.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>Click on 'libraries'.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library6.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>Then paste our 'eagle_fab.lbr' file here.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library7.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>After pasting it, head over to the control panel and right click on the library, followed by clicking 'use'. Alternatively, we can also click on the grey circle.</p>

        <p>A green light should now appear to indicate the library is 'in use'.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/eaglelibrary.png" width=60%>

        <p>Now that everything is configured, we are able to start creating our schematics.</p>

        <h2>Assignment</h2>

        <p>For our assignment, we were supposed to refer to a schematic and reimplement it in Eagle, along with a pull-up resistor and LED. Below is the image of the original schematic.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/04_t45_hello-board.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We first start by heading to the Eagle control panel and creating a new project.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic1.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We then create a new schematic by right clicking on the project folder and clicking on 'new' into 'schematic'.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic2.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We then enter the schematic screen.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic3.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>To start off, I hit Ctrl + S to save the schematic before I start, I will continue to use Ctrl + S throughout to save my work.</p>

        <p>Following that, I click on the grid icon to enable the grid. This will help when laying out the components. Either lines or dots can be used to form the grid but I prefer dots.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic4.png" class="border" width=40%>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic5.png" class="border" width=40%>

        <p>Now that we are done with setting up, we can start creating our schematic.</p>

        <p>In order to add components to the schematic, we use 'add parts'. The shortcut for this is Ctrl Shift A. Alternatively, it can be accessed through 2 ways:</p>
