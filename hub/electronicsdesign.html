        <h1>Electronics Design</h1>

        <p>For electronics design we will be using the electronic design automation (EDA) software EAGLE.</p>

        

        <h2>Adding Libraries</h2>

        <p>Before we can use the component symbols in a schematic, we first have to add their libraries.</p>

        <p>This is very much like Arduino Library addition and updating, simply download the library file followed by pasting it into the EAGLE library folder.</p>

        <p>First we head to https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/pub/libraries/electronics to download the file.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library1.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We then click on the eagle folder to open it.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library2.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We then click on 'fab.lr'.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library3.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We then click on the 'download' button in the top right to download it.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library4.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We then use file explorer to find our Eagle Library folder. By default, it should be in the documents folder. We then open the 'EAGLE' folder.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library5.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>Click on 'libraries'.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library6.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>Then paste our 'eagle_fab.lbr' file here.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/library7.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>After pasting it, head over to the control panel and right click on the library, followed by clicking 'use'. Alternatively, we can also click on the grey circle.</p>

        <p>A green light should now appear to indicate the library is 'in use'.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/eaglelibrary.png" width=60%>

        <p>Now that everything is configured, we are able to start creating our schematics.</p>

        <h2>Assignment</h2>

        <p>For our assignment, we were supposed to refer to a schematic and reimplement it in Eagle, along with a pull-up resistor and LED. Below is the image of the original schematic.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/04_t45_hello-board.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We first start by heading to the Eagle control panel and creating a new project.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic1.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We then create a new schematic by right clicking on the project folder and clicking on 'new' into 'schematic'.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic2.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>We then enter the schematic screen.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic3.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>To start off, I hit Ctrl + S to save the schematic before I start, I will continue to use Ctrl + S throughout to save my work.</p>

        <p>Following that, I click on the grid icon to enable the grid. This will help when laying out the components. Either lines or dots can be used to form the grid but I prefer dots.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic4.png" class="border" width=40%>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic5.png" class="border" width=40%>

        <p>Now that we are done with setting up, we can start creating our schematic.</p>

        <p>In order to add components to the schematic, we use 'add parts'. The shortcut for this is Ctrl Shift A. Alternatively, it can be accessed through 2 ways:</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic6.png" class="border" width=40%>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic7.png" class="border" width=40%>

        <h3>Adding components</h3>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic8.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>This is the adding menu, here I have moved down to the Eagle Library by pressing E. Here, we can browse the library for the various components that we want.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, we can search for the various components that we want to save some time. I'll show this by adding a frame to our schematic.</p>

        <p>We do so by searching for 'frame'. This searches for frames which we can use to encompass our schematic.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic9.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>After selecting an appropriate frame, simply drag it onto the grid.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic10.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>Next up, I'll search for my ATtiny45 IC to show how to use wildcards in the search bar.</p>

        <p>By entering '*tiny45*' in the search bar, we make use of wildcards, this means that do we not need to enter the exact name of the component, hence why our ATtiny45 IC shows up.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic11.png" class="border" width=60%>

        <p>Again, drag and drop onto the desired position on the grid.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic12.png" class="border" width=60%>
        
        <p>Now we have our IC.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic13.png"  width=60%>

        <p>I then proceeded to search for the rest of the components such as the ISP header</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic14.png"  width=60%>

        <p>Now that I have all my components I can start arranging them like in the schematic and wiring them up.</p>

        <p>I have also added the LED, push button and additional resistor as the assignment requires.</p>

    
        <h3>Wiring up the components</h3>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic15.png"  width=60%>

        <p>The shortcut for the wiring net is Alt N. I first begin by wiring up the easy components such as ground and VCC for ICs, refering to the original schematic as much as possible.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic16.png"  width=60%>

        <p>Now that I have wired everything according to the schematic and implemented the pull-up resistor for an input and an LED for its output, I can now finally add values to components such as resistors.</p>
        
        <h3>Adding components' values</h3>

        <p>In order to add the values of our components to the schematic, we need to use the 'values' tool. It can be found on the toolbar on the left as seen below:</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic17.png"  width=60%>

        <p>After selecting the value tool, simply click any components which require their values such as this pull-up resistor. I'll input 10k as 10k ohms should be sufficient for a pull-up resistor.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic18.png"  width=60%>

        <p>After labelling both resistors and the single capacitor we are done with our schematic.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic19.png"  width=60%>

        <h3>Wrong pull-up resistor location</h3>

        <p>After checking my final schematic, I realised that my pull-up resistor was incorrectly placed. It should be placed below the VCC instead of directly to the pin 2 of the ATtiny45. Below is the rectified schematic.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/ED/schematic20.png"  width=60%>

        <p>Now, current will flow into PB3 when the switch is not pressed, hence the input of PB3 being 'pulled up' to the high VCC voltage. When the button is pressed, current will instead flow through the resistor and instead of to PB3, go to the ground, hence PB3 receiving an input of low.</p>
