        <h2>Individual Assignment</h2>

        <p>For our individual assignment, we were tasked with converting the 2 PNG images below to gcode for the CNC machine to cut.</p>

        <p>The image on the left is the outline of board and the image on the right are the traces. By milling the traces followed by cutting the outline, we will get a PCB for the In-System Programming(ISP) board.</p>

        <h3>Stepcraft CNC parameters</h3>

        <p>Here is a table showing the parameters we will be changing for both the traces and outline.</p>

        <h3>Generation of Gcode</h3>

        <p>We first head to https://fabfoundation.github.io/mods, to convert our PNG to a .nc file.</p>

        <p>We arrive and right click anywhere on the page to get a menu, followed by clicking 'programs'.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/EP/mods1.png" class=border>

        <p>This opens up another list from which we click on 'open program'.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/EP/mods2.png" class=border>

        <p>We get a long list from which we scroll down and look for a bolded 'gcode' and we select 'mill 2D PCB'.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/EP/mods3.png" class=border>

        <p>We then get a bunch of nodes which can be configured.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/EP/mods4.png" class=border width=75%>

        <img src="IMAGES/EP/overview1.png" class=border width=75%>

        <p>We refer to the 'read png' node (circled and pointed to in blue)</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/EP/modsoutline1.png" class="border" width=25%>

        <p>Here, we click on 'select png file' and we will be able to select our .png file that we want to convert to gcode with file explorer. In this case, I will be using the ftc_mini_cut.png file.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/EP/modsoutline2.png" class=border width=75%>

        <p>After importing the image, the nodes update to reflect the newly imported file.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/EP/modsoutline3.png" class=border width=35%>

        <img src="IMAGES/EP/modsoutline4.png" class=border width=35%>

        <p>I then proceeded to change the settings as required.</p>
        
        <p>Afterwards, after all the appropriate settings are set, press calculate and the .nc file will start to download.</p>

        <h3>Viewing/verifying the Gcode files</h3>

        <p>Using https://ncviewer.com/, we can view the path of the drill bit from our .nc file.</p>

        <p>In this case, since we're cutting the outline of the PCB, it will run 4 times. This is due to us cutting 0.4mm at a time and wanting our cut depth to be 1.6mm. Hence running 0.4mm deeper each time 4 times.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/EP/ncviewer.png" width=75%>

        <p>Alternatively, using Camotics, we can also view the size of the board to ensure that our dimensions are correct.</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/EP/camotics.png" class=border width=75%> 

        <p>After checking that none of the copper tracks are excluded or missing, we are ready to mill the PCB.</p>

        <h3>Using the CNC machine to mill the PCB</h3>

        <p>We will be using a stepcraft 420 to mill our PCB. We first load our .nc file with the stepcraft software.</p>

        <h4>Prepping the PCB</h4>

          <p>Before cutting, we need to first prepare the copper board for milling.</p>

          <p>Using double sided tape to tape the non copper side of the board, I ensured that there were no overlaps between the tape as that would contribute to making the board not perfectly horizontal.</p>

          <p>I wasn't really able to get many pictures during the process of the milling. However, I was able to get 2 pictures.</p>

          <p>After loading our .nc file, I had to fit the drill bit to the CNC machine. I used a 0.1 mm 30 degree V-bit. After tightening the bit appropriately, I set the X and Y axis followed by callibrating the Z axis with the provided probe.</p>

          <p>Here is an image of the CNC software whilst cutting my board outline. As can be seen, it is cutting at the depth of -1.67mm from the z axis.</p>

          <img src="IMAGES/EP/stepcraftpc.jpg" width=75%>

          <p>Here is an image of the drill whilst it was milling the outline.</p>

          <img src="IMAGES/EP/stepcraftmill.jpg" width=75%>


          <p>After removing it from the copper board we have our product:</p>

          <p>After removing the dead copper with a penknife we have our final product: </p>
  
          <img src="IMAGES/EP/tracesfinal.jpg" width=75%>

          <p>It looks a lot better now.</p>

        <h3>Soldering on the ISP components</h3>

          <p>I first started by soldering on the TINY85 IC. Following that, I tested my IC pins with a multi-meter, ensuring that I had not shorted any pins together from my poor soldering. </p>

          <img src="IMAGES/EP/ISP1.jpg" width=75%>

          <p>I then started on the shorter components such as the resistors and LEDs. I also soldered on my 0.1uF capacitor.</p>

          <img src="IMAGES/EP/ISP2.jpg" width=75%>

          <p>I then soldered on my zener diodes, ensuring that their orientation/polarity were right.</p>

          <img src="IMAGES/EP/ISP3.jpg" width=75%>

          <p>I finally added on my 49.9 ohm resitors to finish the board.</p>

          <img src="IMAGES/EP/ISP4.jpg" width=75%>

          <p>The soldering is pretty poor, it's definitely not going to win any awards but it'll work. I checked all the connections with a DMM.</p>

          <p>Moving forward, I'll have to short together the solder jumper.</p>
