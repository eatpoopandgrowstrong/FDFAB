    <h1>Assignment</h1>

    <p>For our assignment, we will be 3D machining the mold for our molding and casting process.</p>

    <h2>Modelling the item to be cast</h2>

    <p>I first started by modelling the object that I wanted to cast in Fusion 360, I will be making a candle holder:
    </p>

    <p>Before modelling, I used a vernier caliper to measure the diameter of the candle.</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/3DCNC/candleholderfusion1.png" class="border" width=75%>

    <p>I sketched two circles, the inner circle being the diameter of the candle I want to fit inside the candle holder.
    </p>

    <p>The outer circle has a diameter of the inner circle + 2 * 2.5mm which is my desired wall thickness.</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/3DCNC/candleholderfusion2.png" class="border" width=75%>

    <p>I then extruded the inner circle which will where my candle will be sitting on</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/3DCNC/candleholderfusion3.png" class="border" width=75%>

    <p>I followed this by extruding the area in between the two sketched circles to form the wall encompassing my candle
    </p>

    <p>Next, I sketched a simple curving profile </p>

    <img src="IMAGES/3DCNC/candleholderfusion5.png" class="border" width=75%>

    <p>I then used the revolve tool, using the sketch as the profile and the centre of the candle holder as the axis for
      the profile to be revolved around.</p>

    <h2>Modelling the mold</h2>

    <p>Now that I have modelled my candle holder, I'll model the mold. I'll start by sketching a square for a base </p>

    <img src="IMAGES/3DCNC/moldcastfusion1.png" class="border" width=75%>

    <p>I then extruded it by 5mm which will be the thickness of the my base</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/3DCNC/moldcastfusion2.png" class="border" width=75%>

    <p>I then inserted my previously made object as a component, aligning the two centres using the point to point move
      tool</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/3DCNC/moldcastfusion3.png" class="border" width=75%>

    <p>Next, I sketched the walls of the mold on the X axis, angling their insides, this will make removal of the mold
      later easier.</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/3DCNC/moldcastfusion4.png" class="border" width=75%>

    <p>I proceeded to do the same for the Y axis</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/3DCNC/moldcastfusion5.png" class="border" width=75%>

    <p>Following that I extruded all 4 profiles to create the surrounding walls.</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/3DCNC/moldcastfusion6.png" class="border" width=75%>

    <p>Now that I have modelled my mold, I can now generate the toolpath for milling it.</p>

    <h2>Generating the toolpath using Fusion 360</h2>

    <p>We'll head to the manufacturing tab of Fusion 360, click on the design box and it'll open a drop down menu, click
      on the word manufacture to select the manufacturing tab.</p>

    <p>We will also need to </p>
