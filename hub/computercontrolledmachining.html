        <h1>Computer Controlled Machining</h1>

        <h2>Software needed</h2>

            <p>We first start by installing V-Carve Pro. It can be downloaded from https://www.vectric.com/free-trial/vcarve-pro, and clicking on the download button and instead of creating an account, guest downloading.</p>

            <p>We will also need Fusion 360 but I already have that installed.</p>



        <h2>CNC terminology</h2>

            <p></p>
        
        <h2>Assignment</h2>

            <p>For our assignment we have been tasked with using 12 to 15mm plywood  </p>

            <p>We are using a 6mm flat end mill, cut depth= tool diameter, therefore it will take 3 cycles of cutting at multiple depths</p>

            <p>We can do 6+6+3.1 for example to completely cut through the board.</p> 

        <h2>3D modelling</h2>

            <p>I first started by modelling the item that I wanted to be assembled from 15mm plywood. In this case, since I am considering doing a motorised standing desk for my final project, I'll model a small scaled down desk. This can be used to demo cutting of the table top or legs.</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/3DMODEL1.png" class="border" width=75%>

            <p>I started by sketching one of the leg pieces.</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/3DMODEL2.png" class="border" width=75%>

            <p>I then used extruded the sketch by the thickness of the plywood provided (15mm) and offset it.</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/3DMODEL3.png" class="border" width=75%>

            <p>I then extruded the other leg and offset it.</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/3DMODEL4.png" class="border" width=75%>

            <p>I then sketched a rectangle which will be the tabletop.</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/3DMODEL5.png" class="border" width=75%>

            <p>I then extruded it by the thickness of the plywood, I'll cut this body later.</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/3DMODEL6.png" class="border" width=75%>

            <p>I then sketched a middle support for the desk.</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/3DMODEL7.png" class="border" width=75%>

            <p>Extruded the middle support.</p>

            <p>I then proceeded to cut the tabletop, using the bodies of the leg as the tool bodies such that the table top would be able to fit onto the legs.</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/3DMODEL8.png" class="border" width=75%>

            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/3DMODEL9.png" class="border" width=75%>

            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/3DMODEL10.png" class="border" width=75%>

            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/3DMODEL11.png" class="border" width=75%>

            <p>I then created sketches of the various surfaces such that I would be able to cut them using the CNC machine.</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/3DMODEL12.png" class="border" width=75%>

            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/3DMODEL13.png" class="border" width=75%>

            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/3DMODEL14.png" class="border" width=75%>

            <p>Now that modelling is done, I can now import my sketches into VCarve Pro.</p>

        <h2>VCarve Pro</h2>

            <p>When we first open the VCarve Pro application, we are greeted by this:</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/VCARVEPRO1.PNG" class="border" width=75%>

            <p>We'll create a new file</p>

            <h3>Defining our work area</h3>

            <p>Next, enter the dimensions of the piece of wood that we will be working on. In this case, we are working with 1200mm X 1200mm plywood with a thickness of 15mm.</p>

            <p>We'll enter a job size of 1200mm for both the X and Y which is approximately 4 ft. We'll be using plywood with a thickness of 15mm so enter that in as thickness as well.</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/VCARVEPRO2.PNG" class="border" width=75%>

            <p>Proceed to press the 'OK' button</p>

            <h3>Importing our sketches that we want to cut</h3>

            <p>We then import our sketches:</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/VCARVEPRO3.PNG" class="border" width=75%>

            <p>I have 2 identical legs so I'll import my leg dxf twice and tabletop and middle support once.</p>

            <h3>Editing tools</h3>
            
            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/VCARVEPRO4.PNG" class="border" width=75%>

            <p>We can use the move tool by dragging and releasing to select what we want to move followed by clicking and holding on the middle of the dxf that we want move. Don't click and hold on other boxes as it will extend the sketch, contorting the sketch and changing the design. </p>

            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/VCARVEPRO5.PNG" class="border" width=75%>
            
            <h3>Adding dog bones and tabs</h3>

            <p>Now that we have imported our vectors, we'll need to add dog bones and tabs.</p>

            <p>Dog bones will </p>

            <p>Dog bones are for </p>

            <p>We can add dog bones </p>

            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/VCARVEPRO6.PNG" class="border" width=75%>

            <img src="IMAGES/COMPUTERCONTROLLEDMACHINING/VCARVEPRO5.PNG" class="border" width=75%>

            <p>Tabs are </p>

        <br>

        <p>How to secure the wood when the CNC machine is cutting, use vice for smaller pieces, use double sided tape for foam, for us use screws to secure the wood</p>
      
        <p>Use sacrificial layer so that the endmill does not cut into the machine bed</p>

        <p>Do squaring to ensure the bed and as a result the material is perfectly level.</p>
    
        <p>Use dust collector to suck up the saw dust or wood chips.</p>

        <p>Use vcarvepro</p>

        <p>Use fusion 360 cam module</p>
        
        <p>Use vernier caliper to ensure material is of appropriate thickness, </p>

        <p>Test fit construction: Play around with the clearance to ensure a tight fit regardless of the package being disassembled multiple times.</p>

        <p>Put in T bone or dog bone</p>

        <p>Use tab stop </p>

        <p>Onion skinning the thing for aesthetic purposes</p>

        <p>Contour cuts all the way through, pocket cuts parts of the way, no all the way through</p>

        <p>Minimum 300x300 mm , largest is 1.2m x 1.2m thickness is 12~15mm. </p>
