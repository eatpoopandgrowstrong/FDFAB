    <h1>Interfacing and Applications Programming</h1>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>

    <p>For our assignment, we have been tasked with writing an application that interfaces a user with an input/output
      device that we have made.</p>

    <p>Since I have already made my Tiny85 board, I will be reusing it for this assignment.</p>

    <p>This segment will primarily be a continuation from my <a href="embeddedprogramming.html">previous programming
        segment</a></p>

    <p>Now that I am able to send data through a software serial, I can now try writing an application to read the data
      sent and read it.</p>

    <p>I'll be using Processing, it can be downloaded from https://processing.org/download/</p>

    <p>To start, I'll modify my program that I made from the embedded programming segment.</p>

    <!--
    <p>Instead of printing out a string, I'll print out an integer instead. This will make it simpler for processing to understand</p>

    <p>I must admit that I don't fully understand the code that I wrote to create this janky imitation of Mr Chew's
      light bulb.</p>

    <p>In this case, processing uses Java, which is rather similar to C</p>

    <p>I primarily referred to the examples included with processing to write it as well as Mr Chew's examples shown.
    </p>

    <p>Here it is:</p>

    <p>Insert video and code here</p>

    <p>When I first start the program, </p>

    <h3>Modifying the program</h3>

    <p>When starting up the program, the program only runs the size() command, to create a window with the resolution
      stated 720p.</p>

    <p>As a result, an image does not show up on the screen until the LED is first switched on. To make it more
      'realistic', I simply modified the program to load the unlit light bulb at the start.</p>

    <p>Here is a video showing the change:</p>

    <p>Insert video here:</p>

    <p>One thing that I haven't exactly figured out is converting the exact data stream through Serial from Arduino to
      Processing.</p>

    <p>I suspect that it's an error due to the different data types. For instance, when I do a port.print(0); it
      translates to a '48' in processing. I figured this out by using the println command to print the value of the
      input when I was debugging why my code didn't work and the bulbs were not loading in. Using my google-fu, 48 is
      the DEC equivalent of the char '0'. I'll have to figure this out and redo it but for now the code works.</p>

    <p>Another thing that I'll have to figure out is the scaling of the image. The light bulbs are always cut short at
      bottom. Perhaps I'll have to resize the image to fit the entire image in the window.</p>
