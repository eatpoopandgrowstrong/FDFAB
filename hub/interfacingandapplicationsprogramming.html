    <h1>Interfacing and Applications Programming</h1>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>

    <p>For our assignment, we have been tasked with writing an application that interfaces a user with an input/output
      device that we have made.</p>

    <p>Since I have already made my Tiny85 board, I will be reusing it for this assignment.</p>

    <p>This segment will primarily be a continuation from my <a href="embeddedprogramming.html">previous programming
        segment</a></p>

    <p>Now that I am able to send data through a software serial, I can now try writing an application to read the data
      sent and read it.</p>

    <p>I'll be using Processing, it can be downloaded from https://processing.org/download/</p>

    <p>To start, I'll modify my program that I made from the embedded programming segment.</p>

    <p>Instead of printing out a string, I'll print out an integer instead. This will make it simpler for processing to understand</p>
