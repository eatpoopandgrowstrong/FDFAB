    <h1>Module Project After action report</h1>

    <p></p>


    <p>I'm not too happy with regards to time management, I spent quite a while faffing about trying to decide on a
      module project, as can be seen from the multiple draft proposals as well as bill of materials.</p>

    <p>Due to that plus the time it took to finish my assignments, I started on the project extremely
      late. </p>

    <p>The project is lacking that final 10% of work/effort to polish it, for instance the actuation of the turkey
      feathers and small touches such as better cable routing as well as design of an area/box for the microcontroller
      board.</p>

    <p>If time permits, I'd like to finish modelling and 3D printing the various stages of the gas turbine, for instance
      the compressor and its blades. That would make the project much more complete, rather than being a hollow shell.
      Not to mention the actuation of the turkey feathers</p>

    <p>I'm quite happy with my CAD and modelling, though it may have been slow, the quality was ok. </p>

    <p>I'm also quite happy with my design of the gas turbine, I was able to get around limitations such as no overnight
      3D prints through the use of </p>
