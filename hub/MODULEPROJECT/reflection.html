    <h1>Module Project After action report</h1>

    <p></p>


    <p>I'm not too happy with regards to time management, I spent quite a while faffing about trying to decide on a
      module project, as can be seen from the multiple draft proposals as well as bill of materials.</p>

    <p>Due to that plus the time it took to finish my assignments, I started on the project extremely
      late. </p>

    <p>The project is lacking that final 10% of work/effort to polish it, for instance the actuation of the turkey
      feathers and small touches such as better cable routing as well as design of an area/box for the microcontroller
      board.</p>

    <p>I probably could have a made a small compartment built into one of the removal panels </p>

    <p>For instance, removal of brim from 3D prints was substandard, although I was rushing for time, I really should
      have done better here</p>

    <p>Insert image here</p>

    <p>If time permits, I'd like to finish modelling and 3D printing the various stages of the gas turbine, for instance
      the compressor and its blades. That would make the project much more complete, rather than being a hollow shell.
      Not to mention the actuation of the turkey feathers</p>

    <p>I'm quite happy with my CAD and modelling, though it may have been slow, the quality was ok. </p>

    <p>I'm also quite happy with my design of the gas turbine, I was able to get around limitations such as no overnight
      3D prints through printing it sectionally and joining them together with screws and nuts. I don't think it's the
      best engineering solution but I guess it works and it's preferable to gluing which would make the turbine
      impossible to disassemble as well as prevent me from redoing sections in the future. For instance, if I was to
      redo a section such as the now empty compressor section behind the DC motor and fan, I would have to tear the
      glued sections apart. 
    </p>

    <p>I still think that the sectional concept can be improved, some of the joints were definitely
      overcomplicated, using too many screws and nuts as well as odd angles for assembly. I'm not too sure what's the
      exact engineering discipline but if I recall correctly,</p>

    <p>The design of the gas turbine was definitely overcomplicated, this led </p>

    <p>I think that in hindsight, the project was probably a bit too ambitious considering the scope and timeline. I
      probably could have gotten away with creating a re</p>
