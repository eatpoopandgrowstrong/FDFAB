        <h1>Module Project Proposal</h1>

        <p>Make an automated standing desk, use a microcontroller to control the height of the desk. Have for example buttons which can be used to set its height. The buttons can be molded and casted.</p>

        <p>The table top and supporting legs can be CNC machined from 15mmm plywood. Maybe buy my own tabletop as plywood provided isn't exactly confidence inspiring.</p>

        <p>For the microcontroller, make my own Arduino Uno using the Arduino ATMEGA328P, make a custom board with all its pins and mill it from a copper board. Program with the ISP programmer made from embedded programming. </p>

        <p>Have a display and maybe use an ultrasonic sensor to measure and display the height of the desk from the ground. User can set certain presets heights to easily recall different heights such as their preferred standing and sitting height, instead of mannually adjusting the table by hand.</p>

        <p>Interface the 'arduino uno' with two linear actuators/linear servos. These will allow the table to adjust its height. The linear servos can take 12V, use a laptop power supply to provide the required voltage. Connect the linear servos with a transistor/mosfet. Probably mosfet due to 12V used in this scenario.</p>

        <p>Depending on what the IoT topic covers, maybe use some remote or app for a 'smarter' control solution.</p>

        <br>

        <br>

        <p>3D print enclosure for buttons and microcontroller</p>

        <p>CNC wood for the table top and legs</p>

        <p>Cast the covers for the buttons</p>

        <p>Design and manufacture 328 board</p>

        <p>Wire up and program board to control linear actuators/servos,</p>

        <br>

        <br>

        <br>

        <br>

        <br>

        <p>WIP bill of materials:</p>

        <p>2x linear actuators/servos, main cost of project, maybe 50ish each on aliexpress for budget ones.</p>

        <p>Wood for table top</p>

        <p>ATMEGA328</p>

        <p>Copper board for milling of custom board</p>

        <p>12V or 24V power supply, depending on the voltage used for the servo motor</p>

        <p>Mosfets or transistors for the microcontroller</p>

        <p>Push buttons</p>

        <p>LCD display</p>
