      <h1>Project Software</h1>

      <p>This is primarily a continuation from <a href="projectsoftware.html">Project Software</a> where I fabricated my
        board:</p>

      <p>Due to time constraints, I will be primarily focusing on getting my elementary input and output devices such as
        my IR Receiver/Remote and DC motor working first.</p>

      <h2>Smoke Test</h2>

      <p>Before we can program the board, I'll run a quick smoke test to ensure that the board is recognisable/working
        by connecting it to my ISP programmer:</p>

      <p>Insert image of Tiny84 ISP connected to ISP programmer</p>

      <p>Insert images of git bash here</p>

      <p>I ran the command 'avrdude -c usbtiny -p t84':</p>

      <img src="IMAGES/Electronics/SUCCEED2.png" width=75%>

      <p>As can be seen, I initally ran the command for the t84 instead of the t44 which we were using. It still showed
        that the board was working, showing that an AVR device was initialised with a signature. After rechecking my
        chip, I ran the proper command.</p>

      <p>Now that smoke test has been completed without any magic smoke and our t44 is responsive, we can now proceed
        onto programming the board.</p>



      <h2>Programming the Tiny84 board</h2>

      <p>Now that the board works, we can start by creating a dummy program and burning the bootloader for the board,
        specifying settings such as the clock rate of the microcontroller.</p>

      <p>Insert image here</p>

      <p>Something interesting to note here is that there are two options for the pin layout on the Arduino, either
        clockwise or anti clockwise</p>

        <img src="IMAGES/Electronics/Pinout.jpg" width=75%>

      <p>As can be seen, clockwise will result in the first arduino pin 0/A0 starting from pin 13.</p>




      <h3>Testing the IO pins of my microcontroller</h3>

      <p>Next I'll create a simple program to test the functionality of my IO pins.</p>

      <p>It's a simple program where the IO pin is connected to an LED and resistor in series. </p>

      <p>The IO pin will be set to toggle its logic level every 500ms, resulting in a flashing effect.</p>

      <h3>Testing servo pins</h3>

      <p>Next I'll test my servo pins, I'll write a similar program, this time setting the position of the Servo to 0
        degrees, a short delay, followed by moving to 90 degrees before delaying again and repeating the cycle.

      <p>I probably won't be able to finish the actuation for the turkey feathers for the gas turbine mockup but I might
        as well as check its functionality.</p>

      <h3>DC Motor Testing</h3>

      <p>I'll also test my DC motor by attaching two male dupont cables to its terminals:</p>

      <video width=75% controls>

        <source src="VIDEOS/DC Motor Test.mp4" width=75%>

      </video>

      <p>Due to no load being attached to the shaft of the motor, I can safely run it off the USB due to its low current
        consumption.</p>



      <h3>IR remote</h3>

      <p>I will be using the IRremote library https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote</p>

      <p>I'll start by creating a basic sketch for the IR receiver to work:</p>


      <p>Refering to the documentation and the wikia example, the IRreceiver needs to be setup through the </p>

      <p>I'll create a decoder function for my IR receiver as a start. I will also call it in my main loop.</p>



      <p>For the moment, I'll just use a breadboard to demostrate and test the functionality of the IR receiver and
        remote combo as well as the code.</p>

      <p>For the actual demostration, I'll use multiple Male to Female Dupont cables to jumper the IR receiver to the
        board.</p>




      <p>Update: Turns out the Iremote library that I was planning on using is too large for the tiny44's flash, I'll
        have to resort to quickly fabricating a physical push button and LED set up to fufil the IO requirements. I
        certainly did not see this issue coming, I should have checked the size of the library and the storage
        available on the Tiny44. </p>
