    <h1>Project Software</h1>

    <p>This is primarily a continuation from <a href="projectsoftware.html">Project Software</a> where I fabricated my board:</p>

    <p>Due to time constraints, I will be primarily focusing on getting my elementary input and output devices such as my IR Receiver/Remote and DC motor working first.</p>

    <h2>Smoke Test</h2>

    <p>Before we can program the board, I'll run a quick smoke test to ensure that the board is recognisable/working by connecting it to my ISP programmer:</p>

    <p>We'll first start by checking device manager to check that our </p>

    <h2>Programming the Tiny84 board</h2>

    <p>I will be using the IRremote library https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote</p>

  
    <p>I'll start by creating a basic sketch for the IR receiver to work:</p>


    <p>Refering to the documentation and the wikia example, the IRreceiver needs to be setup through the </p>

    <p>I'll create a decoder function for my IR receiver as a start. I will also call it in my main loop.</p>
