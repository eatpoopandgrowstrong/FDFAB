    <h1>Project Electronics</h1>

        <p>In this part on project electronics, I will be covering the library for EAGLE and microcontroller that I will be using for my project.</p>

    <h2>Library and Microcontroller choice</h2>

    <p>I will be using the ATTINY84 microcontroller for my module project, it is a </p>

    <p>Insert datasheet here</p>


    <p>Since Eagle does not come with a preinstalled part for the ATTINY84, I will have to search for one.</p>

    <h2>Searching for a library</h2>

    <p>Googling for a library I found the Sparkfunlibrary</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/Electronics/Sparkfunlibrary.png" width=75% class="border">

    <p>Even though there are multiple libraries, I won't be installing all of them since it'll clutter up the part selection.</p>

    <p>I'll just be installing the SparkFun-IC-Microcontroller.lbr which will contain my attiny84 part.</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/Electronics/Sparkfunlibrary2.png" width=75% class="border">

    <p>After downloading the library as a .zip file, 'unzip' it. I then copied 'SparkFun-IC-Microcontroller.lbr' to my Eagle library folder.</p>

    <h2>Eagle</h2>

    <p>After restarting Eagle, I 'activated' the library. We can now lay out a basic schematic of our board.</p>

    <p>We can begin by inserting a frame into our schematic:</p>

    <p>To start, I'll insert the Tiny84 IC into my schematic. </p>

    <img src="IMAGES/Electronics/schematic2.png" width=75% >

    <p>I then added my ISP header and did some basic nets such as the MOSI/MISO pins:</p>

    <p>Afterwards, I proceeded to add the rest of my components such as the headers for which the DC motors and servo motor will connect to:</p>

    <p>The DC motor </p>

    <h3>Board layout</h3>

    <p>After finishing my schematic, I swapped over to the board view and laid out my components: </p>

    <img src="IMAGES/Electronics/board1.png" width=75% >

    <p>I thickened the VCC and Ground traces to 24mil and had to rename some nets due to the inclusion of 0 ohm links. IF I didn't, Eagle would assume that the two nets were meant to be shorted together, showing up in the DRC as an error.</p>

    <h3>Exporting to mods</h3>

    <p>As can be seen in the previous image, due to my board almost taking up the entire copper blank (75mm x 50mm), I won't be cutting an outline, just the traces out.</p>

    <p>I'll hide all the layers and just show the pads and top layer. Then simply export a 1000 DPI image in monochrome</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/Electronics/boardexport.png" width=75% >

    <p>The exported image:</p>

    <h2>Mods configuration</h2>

    <p>After exporting the image, I can now import it into mods : https://skeatz.github.io/mods/index.html (Right click -> Open Server Program -> scroll down for 'Mill 2D PCB PNG')</p>

    <p>I'll import my image that I exported from the previous section with the 'SELECT PNG FILE' button ,it opens up a file explorer prompt which is then used to select the previously made image:</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/Electronics/modsimport.png" width=75% class = "border">

    <p>We'll then change and enter the appropriate settings for cutting traces:</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/Electronics/modsconfigured.png" width=75% class = "border">

    <p>Then hit the 'calculate' button, the .nc file should automatically start downloading:</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/Electronics/modscalculated.png" width=75% class = "border">


    <p>Now that I have my .nc file, I can transfer it to the stepcraft for it to mill the board.</p>


    <h2>Board milling</h2>

    <p>I copied over my .nc file onto the laptop connected to the stepcraft, I then set my X and Y followed by using the z level sensor to set Z.</p>

    <h2>Board soldering</h2>

    <p>I first began by soldering my IC:</p>

    <p>Insert image here</p>

    <p>I then soldered on the components on hand such as my 1uF cap and 10k&#8486; resistors:</p>

    <p>Insert image here</p>

    <p>I also had a shot at soldering the header pins directly onto the board:</p>

    <p>Insert image here</p>

    <p>I then got my transistors and diodes which I proceeded to solder onto the board:</p>

    <p>Insert image here</p>

    <p>I think that they're alright but might need either more solder to be applied in the future to have a stronger joint, preventing the header pins from breaking off</p>

    <p>I'm quite happy with my soldering, compared with my previous boards, I was better during the flux application process which made things easier as well as cleaner due to my board not drowning in a pool of flux:</p>

    <p>Insert finished board here</p>
