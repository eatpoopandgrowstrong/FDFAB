        <h2>Test Prints</h2>

        <p>This is the DC motor that I'll be using to drive my turbine. I did some measurements with a vernier but I'll
            also have to do some test prints to ensure that my measurements are correct as well as the printer's
            tolerances/dimensions.</p>

        <p>I created a couple of test prints for the external housing for the DC motor for it to fit in as well as the
            shaft for the blades to fit on.</p>

        <p>Even though the measured diameter of the DC shaft was 2mm, none of the test prints were able to fit, I
            created another batch of test prints with slightly larger diameters. This time when printing, I opted to
            print them on a raft such that they would stick together as a batch, making it easier to organise/keep track
            off compared to the loose pieces.</p>
