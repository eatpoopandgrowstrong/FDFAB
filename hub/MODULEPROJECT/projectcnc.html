    <h1>Project CNC</h1>

    <p>In this part I will cover the modelling, manufacture and assembly of my CNC component for this module project.</p>


    <h2>Modelling</h2>

    <p>This probably isn't the best engineering practice, but due to the limited timeframe for this project, I have to get </p>

    <p>I first modelled the baseplate followed by inserting my placeholder turbine on top. Whilst it might not be fully fleshed out on the interior and especially the fan turbine, the proportions of the frame and slots for the stands to fit in should not be changing.</p>



    <p></p>



    <p>To ensure a good fit, I ran a cross sectional view of the stand and the turbine, </p>

    <h2>Fabrication</h2>



    <h2>Assembly</h2>

    <p>When I first assembled the stand, I got the orientation of my middle support piece wrong. Since my middle support piece is not symmetrical, the proportions were off as a result, the nozzle being much closer to the rear.</p>
